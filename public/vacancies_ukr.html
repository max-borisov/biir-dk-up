            <p>You will join a project team with the customer and are typically responsible for a very specific task or subproject.</p>
            <p>The assignments typically last from 6-12 months, but the consultants are often longer by the same customer.</p>
            <p>When the task is completed, the BIIR a new assignment for you - and of course any time in line with or better than the previous.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, we work for you on one of our production companies, but the most common and the most fun is to work out at customers.</p>

          <div class="l-33-fl">
            <h3>Engineering skills</h3>

            <p>You will join one of BIIR's specialist teams and you will experience a professional sparring and challenge at a very high level.</p>
            <p>You know the requirements and working in complex development projects and you always look for perfect solutions both functionally, aesthetically and acc. To current standards.</p>
            <p>And of course you also know that the structure and documentation combined with exuberant creativity and innovative engineering are the key to success.</p>

            <h3>We set actually claim</h3>
            <p>BIIR is a company with plenty of room for everyone, with good opportunities and with really good conditions of employment.</p>
            <p>But we expect much of our consultants.</p>
            <p>Our consultants typically have at least 5-10 years of net experience in their field and passionate about the practical work in the field and for the theory and vision behind.</p>
            <p>As a consultant in BIIR it is important that you are self-propelled and fully aware that the role of a consultant requires more professionally, collegially and socially than a year-long employment in one company.</p>
            <p>You must also be included in one of our core teams. A core team is the collaboration we build up with our Ukrainian consultants and specialists on specific tasks for our Danish customers.</p>
            <p>And as I said, we know that we demand a lot, but we also know that we can meet these.</p>
